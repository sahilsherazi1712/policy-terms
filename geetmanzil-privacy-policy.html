  <h1>Privacy Policy for GeetManzil</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 29, 2025</p>

  <p>
    GeetManzil is an offline app that provides Christian Geets and Zaboors for personal use. 
    Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data the app collects, 
    how it is used, and your rights.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <p>
    GeetManzil does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account and does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information such as your name, email, phone number, or address. 
    We do <strong>not</strong> track your activity across other applications or websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app currently does <strong>not</strong> use analytics, advertising SDKs, or any third-party data collection tools.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
  <p>
    GeetManzil works completely offline. All app-related data is stored only on your device:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Favorites & Collections:</strong> The Geets and Zaboors you mark as favorites or add to collections are stored locally using SQLite.</li>
    <li><strong>Backups & Restore:</strong> Backup files are created only when you choose to do so. These ZIP files are saved only in the location you select.</li>
    <li><strong>Appearance & Settings:</strong> Theme preferences and other in-app settings are stored on your device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    None of this information is sent to any server or shared with any third party.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Optional Information</h2>
  <p>
    When creating a Collection, you may add a name, description, and a local image. 
    This information is stored solely on your device and is never uploaded or shared externally.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Permissions Used</h2>
  <p>
    GeetManzil may request limited device permissions to provide core functionality:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage / Media Access:</strong> Used only for saving and restoring backup files, and for loading optional images that you add to collections. Only the IDs of these images are stored in backup files; no other personal or device information is collected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not access any other device information.
  </p>


  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    GeetManzil is safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 13, 
    or any personal data at all from any user.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Future Features</h2>
  <p>
    Future updates may introduce features such as worship time reminders, content categories, or advertisements.
    If advertisements or third-party services are added, this Privacy Policy will be updated <strong>before</strong> such features are enabled to explain what data (if any) could be collected.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, GeetManzil does <strong>not</strong> use third-party ads or analytics, and does <strong>not</strong> share any data.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since all data remains stored locally on your device, its security depends on your device’s own protection. 
    We recommend using a device lock and backing up your data responsibly.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy as features evolve. 
    Updates will be published within the app and/or on our official website.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
